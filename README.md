# drop_notes
drop_notes is a website where all the collage students can share and access notes at once .
it needs an online server and database so you can nmove all the uploaded images/(notes) so you can fetch them and display on the main page.
here we have used (images) folder to move uploaded files .
index.html file is not necessary
(to see it as working you all need to host it )
you can also check it on your localhost(note:payattention to the (database name) and( table & fields name ) 
# we are still working on it (so far we are on beginning stag of the project.)
